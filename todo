- Persist game id when creating game (db?)

*Gameplay*
- Ask user to input a name when they join a game
  - Allow duplicate names (append a number)
  - Random name generation if the user chooses to be anonymous
- Create a question generator
  - Take X random operands and generate a random operator?
  - Validate client input before sending
  - Have configurable difficulty levels
    - Increase (possible) digits per operand
    - Increase number of operations
- Count-up timer when question has been presented?
- Maximum time per question?
- When a question starts, focus the answer box so user can type answer and hit enter
- Figure out how to handle answer submission priority
  - Start with in-memory storage of all game data.
  - Drop answers into a message queue, process one by one, throw away messages once correctly answered?
    - redis has pub/sub and queues
    - Use separate handler for processing the queue
    - Would require that one server be responsible for handling all messages for each game
  - Use key/value to set a "status" flag for questions while active, use its state to synchronize processing of answers?

*State/Records*
- Use separate collections for games and questions
  - Questions can store their state
- Use Mongoose
- Persist results of each question
- Each client should be able to see the scores of the other players
- When a new client connects, they need to be able to retrieve the current game status
- Store game history, so users can browse previous game results

*Error Handling*
- Can't create game
- Game doesn't exist (redirect back to index)
- Can't connect to game socket
- Lose connection to game socket
